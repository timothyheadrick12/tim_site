# tim_site WIP

My personal website. This was meant to be a website to attach to my resume, but it turned into a sort of playground for web development ideas I thought would be fun. I haven't worked on it in a while, but if I am ever wanting to try out some general web dev ideas that don't warrant their own site, I will most likely do it here.

## The Terminal Welcome Page

This is actually a fully functional terminal created by https://github.com/rohanchandra/javascript-terminal, I used it as a basis and added my own custom function to it. I think it is a super cool project and would love to see appear in some more geeky websites!

## The Home Page

This is one large interactable SVG that is intended to replace your standard navigation bar. As a fun touch, I planned on making the CPU a skills page, the memory a past projects page, and the IO my external links.

## A Navigation Example

Here you can see how the motherboard is meant to replace a standard navigation bar. It lies in the top right corner of the page

## The Skills Page

This is the last page I was working on and is very unfinished. The electricity moving through the wires is actually just a gradient animated with css.
